        1. Insecure Data Storage: Demonstrates insecure storage of sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys.\n
        2. Input Validation: Illustrates the lack of proper input validation, leading to potential security issues like SQL injection and HTML injection\n
        3. Insecure Communication: Shows how sensitive data can be exposed when transmitted over insecure communication channels.\n
        4. Insecure Authentication: Highlights vulnerabilities related to authentication mechanisms, such as weak password policies and session management issues.\n
        5. Insecure Authorization: Demonstrates flaws in authorization mechanisms that can allow unauthorized access to certain functionalities.\n
        6. Insecure Cryptography: Shows the improper use of cryptographic functions, leading to weak or broken encryption.\n
        7. Lack of Binary Protection: Demonstrates weak root detection mechanisms that allow the application running in a rooted environment,
        also there are no dynamic instrumentation detection to prevent hooking with frida.\n</string>
